    Train multiple genre classification models and log them to MLflow.

    **IMPORTANT: This is an intentionally incomplete skeleton for students to implement.**
    Students are expected to complete the TODO sections below to build a complete
    machine learning training pipeline with proper feature engineering, preprocessing,
    model training, and MLflow logging.

    Args:
        data_path: Path to training CSV file (from data pipeline)
        params: Dictionary with hyperparameters from params.yaml

    Implementation Steps:
        1. Load the training data from data_path
        2. Separate features (X) from target (y)
           - Target: 'genre' column (10 classes)
           - Features: audio feature columns
           - Drop metadata columns (id, name, artist, year, popularity, etc.)
        3. Encode genre labels using LabelEncoder
        4. Scale features using StandardScaler
        5. For each model type in params['train']:
           a. Start an MLflow run with run_name
           b. Log parameters from params.yaml
           c. Train the model on scaled X
           d. Calculate accuracy metric
           e. Log metrics to MLflow
           f. Log model artifact with appropriate MLflow function
           g. End the run
